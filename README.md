Hi, my name is Srimon Anida and I am a senior in high school. I am someone who is passionate about the community and just experiencing new things as I took part in Queens Teens Institute for Art & Social Justice and thrived in expressing my perception on prime, important topics through writing. With that passion I am driven to create and learn. During the school year I am a part of classes and programs that allow me to enrich my knowledge of web and app development. Currently I am learning HTML & CSS.
